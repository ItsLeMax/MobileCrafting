# MobileCrafting

Adds an item to minecraft that contains crafting menus

## Purpose

This plugin serves the purpose of delivering an opportunity to avoid crafting and placing a lot of crafting tables and
furnaces only for them to be tossed away.

## Reliability

Items put into the crafting table and furnace will be stored, meaning that they will not vanish after reloading or
stopping the server.

## Installation

1. Download the latest jar [here](https://github.com/ItsLeMax/MobileCrafting/releases/latest)
2. Put it into the plugins folder of your server
